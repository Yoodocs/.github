## Hello ðŸ‘‹

We're developers who need the right documentation service. So, we built it for ourselves and now are sharing it with everyone for free!

Get to know Yoodocs - an AI-powered documentation service.

Some of the features:
- Elementary simple and user-friendly UI/UX.
- Among other features, it is possible to have API versioning, including language versions.
- When creating a different language version, it is possible to automatically translate the language (as shown in the demo features on the landing page).
- The application will be free for those who want to create documentation for their project or keep some notes.
- AI is an assistant when working with the editor.
- An automatic link with the GitHub/GitLab repository will be provided for developers. It will export the documentation you created in .md format in the structure you created.
- The ability to conduct several workspaces and several projects within the framework of the workspace
- ... and much more sweet perks ðŸ˜‹

We aim to make it easier for people to write documentation and notes, to allow them to share their ideas directly in the application and add them using AI.
